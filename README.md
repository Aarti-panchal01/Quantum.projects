# Quantum.projects

A collection of beginner-friendly quantum experiments and games built with **Python**, **Qiskit**, and **Streamlit**.

---

## ✨ Overview

A bunch of small quantum projects I’ve been working on—just for fun and learning. Most of these are beginner-friendly and use Python, Qiskit, and Streamlit. They’re designed to make quantum concepts more approachable through interactive simulations, games, and visual tools.

## 🧩 What's Inside



### 🔐 [QDotCrypt_Encryptor](https://github.com/Aarti-panchal01/qdot_crypt_encryptor)
A conceptual encryption tool inspired by quantum principles, bridging classical cryptography with quantum logic.

### 🎯 [QDot_Visualizer_ML](https://github.com/Aarti-panchal01/qdot_visualizer_ml)
An interactive visualizer that shows how qubits behave, with machine learning to classify and analyze different states and gates.

### 🎲 [Quantum_Dice_Game](https://github.com/Aarti-panchal01/quantum_dice_game)
A simple dice game powered by a true quantum random number generator (QRNG), great for exploring unpredictability in quantum systems.

### 🤝 [Quantum_Prisoners_Dilemma](https://github.com/Aarti-panchal01/quantum_prisoners_dilemma)
A quantum twist on the classic game theory dilemma. Simulates player strategies with quantum randomness and visual payoffs.

### 📈 [Quantum_Stock_Simulator](https://github.com/Aarti-panchal01/quantum_stock_simulator)
Simulates stock market behavior using quantum-inspired stochastic fluctuations. Designed for educational purposes, not real trading.

### 🔢 [QuantumDot_RNG_Simulator](https://github.com/Aarti-panchal01/QuantumDot_RNG_Simulator)
A random number generator using quantum dot simulation principles, demonstrating quantum randomness.
