What happens when you combine quantum mechanics with a classic game of dice? You get unpredictability at a whole new level — and that’s exactly what I built! Welcome to my **Quantum Dice Game**, a fun experiment driven by **Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)**.

---

## 💡 The Idea

Most games rely on pseudo-random number generators — algorithms that simulate randomness. But in the world of quantum physics, **randomness is real**.

In this project, I used the principles of quantum uncertainty to simulate a dice game. Every roll is backed by true quantum randomness — no predictable patterns, no repetition, just pure probabilistic magic.

## 🔍 Key Features

* 🎲 **Quantum Dice Simulation** – Each roll is generated using QRNG principles.
    
* 📊 **Probability Tracker** – Visualizes outcome frequencies over multiple rolls.
    
* 🎮 **CLI-Based Game Interface** – Lightweight, no-frills, and fun to use!
    
* 🔄 **Replay-Friendly** – Keeps rolling until you're ready to quit.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 🐍
    
* **Core Logic**: Quantum-inspired randomness
    
* **Libraries**: `random`, `matplotlib` for visual stats

## 🧪 How QRNG Works (Briefly)

QRNGs use quantum phenomena (like photon path uncertainty or electron spin) to generate numbers. Unlike classical RNGs that are deterministic at heart, QRNGs are inherently **non-deterministic**. This allows us to simulate outcomes with **true entropy**, making it ideal for cryptography, simulations, and — why not — games!

## 👩‍💻 Why I Built This

As a first-year [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) student and quantum computing enthusiast, I wanted to merge learning with fun. This was a creative way to internalize **quantum randomness** while sharpening my Python and simulation-building skills.

Also, who wouldn’t want to say they’ve built a dice that listens to quantum mechanics?
