How do you understand something as complex and invisible as a quantum state? You **visualize it** — and better yet, you **enhance it with machine learning**.

Welcome to **qdot\_visualizer\_ml**, a project I built to **simulate and visualize quantum states** in an interactive, intuitive way — powered by Python and enriched with ML.

## 🧠 What Is It?

`qdot_visualizer_ml` is an **interactive quantum state visualizer** that models quantum behavior (like qubit states and superposition) and applies **machine learning** to predict and visualize the evolution of these states.

It's like putting quantum logic under a microscope 🧬 — but with colors, plots, and live feedback.

## 🔍 Key Features

* 🌌 **Visual Quantum States** – Real-time plotting of Bloch spheres and quantum dot states.
    
* 🤖 **ML-Augmented Analysis** – Uses trained ML models to predict quantum state transitions.
    
* 🎛️ **Interactive Controls** – Adjust qubit parameters and instantly see the effect.
    
* 🧪 **Educational Tool** – Great for beginners wanting to "see" how quantum behaves.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
    
* **Libraries**: `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `qiskit`, custom ML models
    
* **Category**: Data Visualization + Quantum Simulation
    

---

## 🧪 How It Works

* You input or simulate quantum states (superpositions, entangled qubits).
    
* These states are run through basic transformations (like Hadamard or Pauli gates).
    
* ML models (e.g., regressors or classifiers) predict how states may evolve or stabilize.
    
* Results are visualized in an intuitive way — **no heavy math needed**.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As someone deeply curious about both **quantum mechanics** and **machine learning**, I wanted to create a tool that makes abstract quantum ideas more **tangible and visual** — and ML made that even more insightful.

This project helped me:

* Learn how to visualize quantum behavior.
    
* Use ML not just for predictions but for **interpreting physical simulations**.
    
* Build a beginner-friendly educational resource.
