# QDotCrypt â€“ Quantum Dot RNG-Based Secure Message Encryptor

This project uses simulated quantum dot-inspired randomness to generate secure encryption keys. These keys are used to encrypt and decrypt messages using symmetric encryption.

## Features
- Generates a base64-encoded encryption key using QD-inspired logic
- Encrypts user messages securely
- Decrypts encrypted messages using the same key
- Demonstrates how quantum randomness strengthens encryption

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Cryptography (Fernet)
