# 📈 Simulating Stock Markets with Quantum Fluctuations

What if stock markets were governed not just by human behavior, but also by **quantum probability**?

Welcome to my project: `quantum_stock_simulator` — a quantum-inspired financial model that simulates **stock price behaviors** using **stochastic quantum fluctuations**.

---

## 💡 Why I Built This

Traditional market simulations use **Brownian motion** or **geometric random walks**. I wanted to explore an **unconventional path** — leveraging quantum-inspired randomness to simulate unpredictability in stock price movement.

The result? A tool that blends **quantum theory** with **financial modeling**.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

`quantum_stock_simulator` is a **Python-based simulator** that:

* 📉 Models price movement using **quantum-inspired noise**
    
* 📊 Generates stochastic outputs mimicking real-world stock behavior
    
* 🔀 Introduces **non-deterministic price jumps** based on qubit-state fluctuation logic
    

It’s **not financial advice**, but it’s definitely a fun way to learn how **quantum randomness** can impact simulations.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
    
* **Libraries**: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, custom quantum RNG functions
    
* **Domain**: Quantum + Finance
    

## 🚀 GitHub Repo

🔗 [quantum\_stock\_simulator](https://github.com/Aarti-panchal01/quantum_stock_simulator)

Open-sourced and ready for contributions!

## 🧪 How It Works

* Instead of pseudo-random number generation, it uses **quantum randomness logic**.
    
* Qubit-inspired variables impact whether stock prices rise, fall, or remain stable.
    
* The price evolution is plotted, reflecting **quantum uncertainty in markets**.
    

This can be useful for:

* 📚 Learning simulations
    
* 🎓 Teaching quantum uncertainty
    
* 🧪 Experimental finance

## 🧲 Real-World Relevance?

Quantum computing is starting to impact finance — from optimization to fraud detection.

This project is an **experimental peek** into how **quantum randomness** might offer a new layer of realism in modeling **complex financial systems**.
