A compilation of quantum-inspired Python projects I built as a first-year [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) student — combining curiosity, code, and Qubits.  
*By Aarti Panchal*

## 🧠 Why Quantum?

Quantum computing was something I thought only PhDs and physicists touched. But over my first year as a B.Tech student, I challenged myself to demystify it — not through theory, but by building real-world inspired Python projects.

In this blog, I bring together **six quantum-themed projects** that I developed and open-sourced. Some are simulations, some games, and some playful experiments in randomness, encryption, and decision-making.

Each taught me a different concept — and hopefully, will inspire you to build your own.

## 🧩 The Quantum Projects

Here's a snapshot of the six quantum-powered apps:

| 🧪 Project | 🔗 Blog |
| --- | --- |
| 🎲 **Quantum Dice Game** — randomness meets uncertainty | [Rolling with Quantum](https://hashnode.com/post/cmar4ooqd000709l8bpio5chs) |
| 🔐 **QDot Crypt Encryptor** — quantum-inspired XOR encryption | [qdot\_crypt\_encryptor](https://hashnode.com/post/cmar2rql9000509i37cyq167a) |

## 🔍 Favorite Highlights

* 🧪 **Simulating uncertainty** using quantum dice, where outcomes are affected by probability distributions rather than pure randomness.
    
* 🔐 **Building a tiny XOR-based encryptor** that mimics quantum-like key variability.
    
* 📉 **Injecting uncertainty into stock market graphs**, simulating market predictions under a quantum framework.
    
* 🧬 **Using the particle-in-a-box model** to simulate energy level shifts in quantum dots.
    
* 🧠 **Training a basic ML model** to predict quantum states, a small glimpse of where AI meets quantum physics.

## 👋 Final Thoughts

This quantum series started with a simple dice roll and took me deep into the fascinating intersection of physics, coding, and mathematics. I learned that quantum computing is not out of reach — you can start small, simulate ideas, and build intuition along the way.

If you're curious about quantum computing, don't wait — start building.
