## 🧠 What is Quantum Prisoner’s Dilemma?

The classical **Prisoner’s Dilemma** is one of the most famous problems in game theory — it showcases how two rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it’s in their best interest.

In this project, I decided to **reimagine this dilemma using quantum mechanics**, where strategies are not just limited to "Cooperate" or "Defect" — but can exist in **superposition**, making the outcomes probabilistic and non-intuitive.

## 💻 The Build

I simulated quantum strategies using Python. Instead of binary outcomes, I introduced **quantum matrices (unitary gates)** to determine the players' choices. Here's what I implemented:

* Quantum state initialization
    
* Strategy matrices for each player
    
* Quantum entanglement between players
    
* Measurement to derive classical outcomes
    

Each round ends in outcomes that would **never be possible in classical game theory** — showing how **entanglement can foster cooperation** or shift payoffs dramatically.

## 🎓 What I Learned

* How entanglement impacts rational decisions
    
* Matrix-based strategy modeling
    
* The thin line between quantum randomness and game logic
    
* How quantum mechanics can redefine social and economic theory

## 🚀 Why It Matters

This project isn’t just a coding challenge — it's a glimpse into the future of **quantum decision-making**. Imagine businesses or governments using **quantum models to predict cooperation or betrayal** in negotiations.
