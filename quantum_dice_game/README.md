# Quantum-Inspired Dice Game 🎲⚛️

This is a quantum-inspired probability game where you roll dice using two mechanisms:
1. **Classical** (uniform probability)
2. **Quantum-inspired** (biased probability mimicking quantum anomalies)

## Concepts
- Classical vs Quantum randomness
- Probability evolution and game theory
- Visualization of outcome distributions

## Technologies
- Python
- Streamlit
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## Run It
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
