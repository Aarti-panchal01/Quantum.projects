# Quantum Dot Behavior Visualizer (Physics + ML)

This project visualizes how the size of quantum dots affects their emitted wavelength based on the quantum confinement effect. A small machine learning model (polynomial regression) is trained on synthetic data to predict the emission characteristics.

## Features
- Simulates QD size vs wavelength behavior
- Fits a polynomial regression model using scikit-learn
- Generates visual plot comparing real and predicted values

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
